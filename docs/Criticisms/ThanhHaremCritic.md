<summary>List of assumed members</summary>
<pre>
+ Linh
+ Nghi
+ Vy
</pre>
</details> 

# Indications
These will explain why the theory is partially accurate, the first one will be the most accurate, and the last one will be the least accurate.
## Indication #1
On December 3rd 2021, there is a recent of choosing music group, Thành was either chosen, or been chosen to a music group consiting of the above mentioned individuals which are assumed to be in the harem.

This can be normal as well as they are what so called *best-friends*. But indiviual Hoàng tried to choose that music group, but the individuals in the group which are assumed to be in the harem denied the request. Hoàng explained in the following snippet of chat.

Translation:
Message #1: I tried to choose the same group with him
Message #2: Because he is my friend
Message #3: But [Extended the last character of the message]
Message #4: They said they already have Thành so they don't need me.
Message #5: So it turns out that they simps for Thành and Thành simps for them

</pre>
**Conclusion**

This indicates that Thành as his assumed harem members are simping for each other, resulting in a harem.

## Indication #2
During November and December 2021, Thành was convinced to play Genshin Impact by the assumed harem members.

However, this is not the case. The reason that this can be an indicator is that Thành used to describe Genshin as sexualized characters in-game. In the following image, Thành described how Genshin is sexualized and agreed with another person on the same topic.

People in chat, imfuckedup is Thành's friend, thanhred is individual Thành, chat conversation is in Discord.

Translation:
Message #1 imfuckedup: I know that how is Genshin
Message #2 imfuckedup: and I suggest you not to get in that thing
Message #3 thanhred: You played it already? 
Message #4 imfuckedup: No
Message #5 imfuckedup: I haven't played it yet
Message #6 imfuckedup: I have seen its fanart and advertisements
Message #7 thanhred: I think Genshin's graphics is good
Message #8 imfuckedup: Seeing it 70% of them are sexualized lolis
Message #9 thanhred: Because I already met the graphics and played Keieru played this with pokemon
Message #10 thanhred: [Reply to Message #7] ye
Message #11 thanhred: A lot of porn videos
Message #12 thanhred: I clicked on a random video and see like that
Message #12 imfuckedup: [Reply to Message #11] I agree
Message #13 thanhred: And it is recording boobs bouncing.
</pre>

After a while since this happened, he reported that he is playing Genshin Impact, talking about in-game stuff, etc. When *imfuckedup* mentioned about it, thanhred replied that

"I play it because I like it"

Assumed harem members also tried to stop *imfuckedup* from mentioning about this.

This concludes why Genshin partially proves the Thành's harem criticism.
