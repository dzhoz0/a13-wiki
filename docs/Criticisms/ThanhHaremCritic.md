This can be normal as well as they are what so called *best-friends*. But indiviual Hoàng tried to choose that music group, but the individuals in the group which are assumed to be in the harem denied the request. Hoàng explained in the following snippet of chat.

Translation:
Message #1: I tried to choose the same group with him
Message #2: Because he is my friend
Message #3: But [Extended the last character of the message]
Message #4: They said they already have Thành so they don't need me.

**Conclusion**

This indicates that Thành as his assumed harem members are simping for each other, resulting in a harem.
